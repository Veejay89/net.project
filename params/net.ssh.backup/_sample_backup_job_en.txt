# 1. NEVER, under any circumstances, save plaintext passwords for devices in productive environment! Neither this file and in any other.
#    The password in this file MUST be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm. See cfsec module description for more information.
#    The password specified in plaintext will NOT be used and will result error during the backup job.
# 2. Even using encrypted passwords does not guarantee their safety. This option should be used only with the assessment and acceptance of possible risks of compromising credentials.
#    Whenever possible, always use the minimum necessary access rights and limit the scope of use for the selected account. For example, using RADIUS server.
# 3. Use only Latin characters (en) to define parameters in this file.

# -----
# GLOBAL PARAMETERS
# -----

# :: backup_path [required, single]
# Defines the absolute path (/*) to the default directory for storing backups.
# Backup path can be redefined for every single device below.
# Examples
# backup_path = /bkp
# backup_path = /bkp/datacenter

backup_path = /bkp

# :: default_username [optional, single]
# Defines the username that will be used to connect to network devices by default.
# Note, this parameter will be completely ignored if:
# - the script running with the --credentials key;
# - the connection credentials are overridden for the specific device below.
# Examples
# default_username = admin

default_username = admin

# :: default_password [optional, single]
# Defines the password for the above account (default_username).
# Note that this parameter will be completely ignored if:
# - the script running with the --credentials key;
# - the connection credentials are overridden for the specific device below.
# The password MUST be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm. See cfsec module description for more information.
# NEVER, under any circumstances, save plaintext passwords for devices in productive environment!
# Examples
# default_password = *****

default_password = *****

# :: decryption_key [optional*, single]
# Required parameter if one or more passwords are declared among the settings. It may not be used only if the script is run with the --credentials key.
# Defines the secret Fernet key. Generated using the cfsec module functionality. See the cfsec module description for more information.
# Examples
# decryption_key = org_secret_key

decryption_key = org_secret_key


# -----
# INTEGRATION WITH ZABBIX API
# -----

# :: zabbix_server [mandatory*, single]
# Defines Zabbix server's address as an IP address or FQDN (not a URL).
# Examples
# zabbix_server = zabbix.yourdomain.ru
# zabbix_server = 192.168.1.1

zabbix_server = zabbix.yourdomain.ru

# :: zabbix_username [mandatory*, single]
# Defines the username that will be used to connect to the Zabbix API.
# This parameter will be ignored if the script running with the --credentials key.
# Examples
# zabbix_username = zabbix_api_user

zabbix_username = zabbix_api_user

# :: zabbix_password [mandatory*, single]
# Defines the password for the above account (zabbix_username).
# This parameter will be ignored if the script running with the --credentials key.
# The password MUST be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm. See cfsec module description for more information.
# NEVER, under any circumstances, save plaintext passwords for devices in productive environment!
# Examples
# zabbix_password = *****

zabbix_password = *****

# :: zabbix_group [mandatory*, plural]
# Defines groups of Zabbix objects that combine network devices to be backed up.
# It is allowed to list several groups, each group is specified in a separate line
# Examples
# zabbix_group = NET_ORG_L3
# zabbix_group = NET_ORG_L2

zabbix_group = NET_ORG_L3
zabbix_group = NET_ORG_L2


# -----
# LIST OF NETWORK DEVICES
# -----

# :: device [optional, multiple]
# Adds or overrides one or more network device attributes listed in the same line with the separator ";"
# name - the name of the device. Defines the folder in the root directory where the backup copy will be placed.
# ip - the IP address of the device. A unique parameter that defines the connection point to the device.
# username - the username that will be used to connect to the network device.
# password - password for the above account (username)
# path - the absolute path (/*) to the backup directory for a specific device.
# enable - tbd
# port - TCP port that is listened to on the SSH connection device.
# os - ios/nx-os/asa/vyos. When creating a backup, a script suitable for the selected operating system will be used.

# The device definition in this section is performed for two different tasks:
# 1. Adding a new device to the backup task, in manual mode;
#2. Redefining default settings for network devices imported from Zabbix groups.
# This block is optional if data about network devices is planned to be extracted from Zabbix, and the same account (default_username) is used for authentication on them.

# Examples

# device = 192.168.0.1
# A device available at 192.168.0.1:22 will be added to the backup task. SSH port (TCP/22) is used by default.
# default_username/default_password will be used for authentication.
# The backup mechanism will be applied for Cisco IOS systems (by default).
# If hostname is read from the device configuration, the RC will be placed in the backup_path/hostname/ directory. Otherwise - backup_path/192.168.0.1/

# device = name=ORG-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.1
# The difference from the previous scenario is that the hostname of the device is specified manually. The RC will be placed in the backup_path/ORG-ROUTER directory/

# device = name=ORG-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.1;port=4422
# The device description specifies the port, the connection to the device will be made at the address 192.168.0.1:4422

# device = name=ORG-IOS-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.2;os=ios
# device = name=ORG-VyOS-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.2;os=vyos
# device = name=ORG-ASA-FIREWALL;ip=192.168.0.3;os=asa
# device = name=ORG-DC-SWITCH;ip=192.168.0.3;os=nx-os
# If the os parameter is explicitly redefined (ios by default), a script suitable for the selected operating system will be used when creating a backup.
# Supported values: ios/NX-os/asa/vyos

# device = name=ORG-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.1;username=admin2;password=*****
# The description defines the credentials for connecting to a specific device (username/password)
# The password MUST be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm. See cfsec module description for more information.
# NEVER, under any circumstances, save passwords from a productive environment in the clear!

# device = name=ORG-ROUTER;ip=192.168.0.1;path=/bkp/special_dir
# The device has a directory for storing backups (/bkp/special_dir). The backup_path parameter will be ignored for a specific device.
